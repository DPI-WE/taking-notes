# Taking Notes üìù
In this lesson, you will learn how to effectively take notes using Markdown. Keeping well-organized notes is essential for tracking your progress, recording important information, and staying on top of tasks. This lesson will guide you through setting up a notes folder, using Markdown for note-taking, and leveraging Git for version control and sharing.

## Why Take Notes?
Keeping notes offers several benefits:

- **Clarification and Internalization**: Writing about what you‚Äôre doing helps clarify and internalize the information.
- **Documentation**: Notes serve as a record for what you work on each day, which is helpful for your future self and preparing for meetings (eg Stand-ups).
- **Reference**: When you need to perform the same task again in the future, your notes serves as a cheat sheet.
- **Professional Showcase**: Your notes serve as a greate source for your TIL blogs, which looks great to prospective employers, demonstrating both your writing and technical ability.

## Why Markdown?
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily and readably. Here are some reasons why Markdown is beneficial for note-taking:

- **Simplicity**: Markdown's syntax is straightforward and easy to learn. You can format text without needing to know complex commands.
- **Readability**: Notes written in Markdown are clean and easy to read, even in plain text format.
- **Portability**: Markdown files are plain text files, which means they can be opened and edited on any device and with any text editor.
- **Compatibility**: Markdown can be converted to various formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word, making it versatile for different uses.
- **Integration**: Many tools and platforms support Markdown, including GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, and documentation generators like MkDocs and Jekyll.

## Setting Up Your Notes Folder

### Step 1: Create a Notes Folder
Create a `notes` folder inside your `Workspace` folder. This will be the designated location for all your notes.

### Step 2: Using Markdown for Notes
Create a New Markdown File Each Day. (`*.md`) Each morning, create a new Markdown file for your daily notes. This can include how you spend your time, meeting notes, important links, and your to-do list for the day.

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code
Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code is a powerful and user-friendly code editor that is excellent for writing notes in Markdown. [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Step 4: Optional - Set Up a Git Repository
Make Your Notes Folder a Git Repository. This step is optional but highly recommended. By making your notes folder a Git repository, you can version control your notes and easily share them between multiple devices. Initialize a Git repository in your notes folder and commit your changes regularly. Push commits to a GitHub repository to keep your notes backed up and accessible from anywhere.

## Example of a Daily Notes File
Here is an example of what your daily Markdown file might look like:

```markdown
